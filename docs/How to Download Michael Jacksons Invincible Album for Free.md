Michael Jackson's Invincible album was his last studio album before his death in 2009. The album was released on October 30, 2001, and received mixed reviews from critics and fans. Some praised the album for its production, vocals and diversity, while others criticized it for being too long, inconsistent and outdated. The album sold over six million copies worldwide, but it was considered a commercial failure compared to Jackson's previous albums.
 
The album was recorded between 1997 and 2001, and involved several producers and collaborators, such as Rodney Jerkins, Teddy Riley, R. Kelly, Dr. Freeze and Andreao Heard. The album cost over $30 million to produce, making it one of the most expensive albums ever made. The album also faced several problems during its release, such as disputes with Sony Music, lack of promotion and leaks on the internet.
 
Despite the challenges, the album still produced some memorable songs that showcased Jackson's talent and versatility. The album's first single, "You Rock My World", was a smooth R&B song that featured a spoken intro by Chris Tucker and a rap verse by Jay-Z on some versions. The song peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song also received a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.
